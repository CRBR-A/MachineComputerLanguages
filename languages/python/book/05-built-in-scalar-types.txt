When discussing Python variables and objects, we mentioned the fact that
all Python objects have type information attached. Here we'll briefly
walk through the built-in simple types offered by Python. We say "simple
types" to contrast with several compound types, which will be discussed
in the following section.

Python's simple types are summarized in the following table:

\*\*Python Scalar Types\*\*

| Type       | Example      | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `int`      | `x = 1`      | integers (i.e., whole numbers)                               |
| `float`    | `x = 1.0`    | floating-point numbers (i.e., real numbers)                  |
| `complex`  | `x = 1 + 2j` | Complex numbers (i.e., numbers with real and imaginary part) |
| `bool`     | `x = True`   | Boolean: True/False values                                   |
| `str`      | `x = 'abc'`  | String: characters or text                                   |
| `NoneType` | `x = None`   | Special object indicating nulls                              |

We'll take a quick look at each of these in turn.

## Integers[¶](#Integers)

The most basic numerical type is the integer. Any number without a
decimal point is an integer:

In \[1\]:

```python
    x = 1
    type(x)
```

Out\[1\]:

```
    int
```

Python integers are actually quite a bit more sophisticated than
integers in languages like `C`. C integers are fixed-precision, and
usually overflow at some value (often near $2^{31}$ or $2^{63}$,
depending on your system). Python integers are variable-precision, so
you can do computations that would overflow in other languages:

In \[2\]:

```python
    2 ** 200
```

Out\[2\]:

```
    1606938044258990275541962092341162602522202993782792835301376
```

Another convenient feature of Python integers is that by default,
division up-casts to floating-point type:

In \[3\]:

```python
    5 / 2
```

Out\[3\]:

```
    2.5
```

Note that this upcasting is a feature of Python 3; in Python 2, like in
many statically-typed languages such as C, integer division truncates
any decimal and always returns an integer:

```
    # Python 2 behavior
    >>> 5 / 2
    2
```

To recover this behavior in Python 3, you can use the floor-division
operator:

In \[4\]:

```python
    5 // 2
```

Out\[4\]:

```
``` 
2
```
```

Finally, note that although Python *2.x* had both an `int` and `long`
type, Python 3 combines the behavior of these two into a single `int`
type.

## Floating-Point Numbers[¶](#Floating-Point-Numbers)

The floating-point type can store fractional numbers. They can be
defined either in standard decimal notation, or in exponential notation:

In \[5\]:

```python
    x = 0.000005
    y = 5e-6
    print(x == y)
```

```
    True
```

In \[6\]:

```python
    x = 1400000.00
    y = 1.4e6
    print(x == y)
```

```
    True
```

In the exponential notation, the `e` or `E` can be read "...times ten to
the...", so that `1.4e6` is interpreted as $\~1.4 \\times 10^6$.

An integer can be explicitly converted to a float with the `float`
constructor:

In \[7\]:

```python
    float(1)
```

Out\[7\]:

```
    1.0
```

### Aside: Floating-point precision[¶](#Aside:-Floating-point-precision)

One thing to be aware of with floating point arithmetic is that its
precision is limited, which can cause equality tests to be unstable. For
example:

In \[8\]:

```python
    0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
```

Out\[8\]:

```
    False
```

Why is this the case? It turns out that it is not a behavior unique to
Python, but is due to the fixed-precision format of the binary
floating-point storage used by most, if not all, scientific computing
platforms. All programming languages using floating-point numbers store
them in a fixed number of bits, and this leads some numbers to be
represented only approximately. We can see this by printing the three
values to high precision:

In \[9\]:

```python
    print("0.1 = {0:.17f}".format(0.1))
    print("0.2 = {0:.17f}".format(0.2))
    print("0.3 = {0:.17f}".format(0.3))
```

```
    0.1 = 0.10000000000000001
    0.2 = 0.20000000000000001
    0.3 = 0.29999999999999999
```

We're accustomed to thinking of numbers in decimal (base-10) notation,
so that each fraction must be expressed as a sum of powers of 10: $$ 1
/8 = 1\\cdot 10^{-1} + 2\\cdot 10^{-2} + 5\\cdot 10^{-3} $$ In the
familiar base-10 representation, we represent this in the familiar
decimal expression: $0.125$.

Computers usually store values in binary notation, so that each number
is expressed as a sum of powers of 2: $$ 1/8 = 0\\cdot 2^{-1} + 0\\cdot
2^{-2} + 1\\cdot 2^{-3} $$ In a base-2 representation, we can write this
$0.001\_2$, where the subscript 2 indicates binary notation. The value
$0.125 = 0.001\_2$ happens to be one number which both binary and
decimal notation can represent in a finite number of digits.

In the familiar base-10 representation of numbers, you are probably
familiar with numbers that can't be expressed in a finite number of
digits. For example, dividing $1$ by $3$ gives, in standard decimal
notation: $$ 1 / 3 = 0.333333333\\cdots $$ The 3s go on forever: that
is, to truly represent this quotient, the number of required digits is
infinite\!

Similarly, there are numbers for which binary representations require an
infinite number of digits. For example: $$ 1 / 10 =
0.00011001100110011\\cdots\_2 $$ Just as decimal notation requires an
infinite number of digits to perfectly represent $1/3$, binary notation
requires an infinite number of digits to represent $1/10$. Python
internally truncates these representations at 52 bits beyond the first
nonzero bit on most systems.

This rounding error for floating-point values is a necessary evil of
working with floating-point numbers. The best way to deal with it is to
always keep in mind that floating-point arithmetic is approximate, and
*never* rely on exact equality tests with floating-point values.

## Complex Numbers[¶](#Complex-Numbers)

Complex numbers are numbers with real and imaginary (floating-point)
parts. We've seen integers and real numbers before; we can use these to
construct a complex number:

In \[10\]:

```python
    complex(1, 2)
```

Out\[10\]:

```
    (1+2j)
```

Alternatively, we can use the "`j`" suffix in expressions to indicate
the imaginary part:

In \[11\]:

```python
    1 + 2j
```

Out\[11\]:

```
    (1+2j)
```

Complex numbers have a variety of interesting attributes and methods,
which we'll briefly demonstrate here:

In \[12\]:

```python
    c = 3 + 4j
```

In \[13\]:

```python
    c.real  # real part
```

Out\[13\]:

```
    3.0
```

In \[14\]:

```python
    c.imag  # imaginary part
```

Out\[14\]:

```
    4.0
```

In \[15\]:

```python
    c.conjugate()  # complex conjugate
```

Out\[15\]:

```
    (3-4j)
```

In \[16\]:

```python
    abs(c)  # magnitude, i.e. sqrt(c.real ** 2 + c.imag ** 2)
```

Out\[16\]:

```
    5.0
```

## String Type[¶](#String-Type)

Strings in Python are created with single or double quotes:

In \[17\]:

```python
    message = "what do you like?"
    response = 'spam'
```

Python has many extremely useful string functions and methods; here are
a few of them:

In \[18\]:

```python
    # length of string
    len(response)
```

Out\[18\]:

```
``` 
4
```
```

In \[19\]:

```python
    # Make upper-case. See also str.lower()
    response.upper()
```

Out\[19\]:

```
    'SPAM'
```

In \[20\]:

```python
    # Capitalize. See also str.title()
    message.capitalize()
```

Out\[20\]:

```
    'What do you like?'
```

In \[21\]:

```python
    # concatenation with +
    message + response
```

Out\[21\]:

```
    'what do you like?spam'
```

In \[22\]:

```python
    # multiplication is multiple concatenation
    5 * response
```

Out\[22\]:

```
    'spamspamspamspamspam'
```

In \[23\]:

```python
    # Access individual characters (zero-based indexing)
    message[0]
```

Out\[23\]:

```
    'w'
```

For more discussion of indexing in Python, see
["Lists"](06-built-in-data-structures.html#Lists).

## None Type[¶](#None-Type)

Python includes a special type, the `NoneType`, which has only a single
possible value: `None`. For example:

In \[24\]:

```python
    type(None)
```

Out\[24\]:

```
    NoneType
```

You'll see `None` used in many places, but perhaps most commonly it is
used as the default return value of a function. For example, the
`print()` function in Python 3 does not return anything, but we can
still catch its value:

In \[25\]:

```python
    return_value = print('abc')
```

```
    abc
```

In \[26\]:

```python
    print(return_value)
```

```
    None
```

Likewise, any function in Python with no return value is, in reality,
returning `None`.

## Boolean Type[¶](#Boolean-Type)

The Boolean type is a simple type with two possible values: `True` and
`False`, and is returned by comparison operators discussed previously:

In \[27\]:

```python
    result = (4 < 5)
    result
```

Out\[27\]:

```
    True
```

In \[28\]:

```python
    type(result)
```

Out\[28\]:

```
    bool
```

Keep in mind that the Boolean values are case-sensitive: unlike some
other languages, `True` and `False` must be capitalized\!

In \[29\]:

```python
    print(True, False)
```

```
    True False
```

Booleans can also be constructed using the `bool()` object constructor:
values of any other type can be converted to Boolean via predictable
rules. For example, any numeric type is False if equal to zero, and True
otherwise:

In \[30\]:

```python
    bool(2014)
```

Out\[30\]:

```
    True
```

In \[31\]:

```python
    bool(0)
```

Out\[31\]:

```
    False
```

In \[32\]:

```python
    bool(3.1415)
```

Out\[32\]:

```
    True
```

The Boolean conversion of `None` is always False:

In \[33\]:

```python
    bool(None)
```

Out\[33\]:

```
    False
```

For strings, `bool(s)` is False for empty strings and True otherwise:

In \[34\]:

```python
    bool("")
```

Out\[34\]:

```
    False
```

In \[35\]:

```python
    bool("abc")
```

Out\[35\]:

```
    True
```

For sequences, which we'll see in the next section, the Boolean
representation is False for empty sequences and True for any other
sequences

In \[36\]:

```python
    bool([1, 2, 3])
```

Out\[36\]:

```
    True
```

In \[37\]:

```python
    bool([])
```

Out\[37\]:

```
    False
```
