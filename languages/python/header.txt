This website contains the full text of my free O'Reilly report, [*A
Whirlwind Tour of
Python*](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp).

*A Whirlwind Tour of Python* is a fast-paced introduction to essential
features of the Python language, aimed at researchers and developers who
are already familiar with programming in another language. The material
is particularly designed for those who wish to use Python for data
science and/or scientific programming, and in this capacity serves as an
introduction to my longer book, [*The Python Data Science
Handbook*](http://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook).

The content is also available [on
Github](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) in the form of
Jupyter Notebooks, or from O'Reilly site as a [free
e-book](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp)
or [free
pdf](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf).
